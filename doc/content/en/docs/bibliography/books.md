* [Modern Compiler Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Implement-Andrew-Appel/dp/0521607647) - Provides a complete description of the compilation process from beginning to end, divided into two parts: the first describes a simple, monomorphic, first-order compiler, and the second delves into more advanced topics such as garbage collection, optimization, and functional languages.  Available for ML (linked), Java, and C.
* [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-MIT-Press/dp/0262162091) - A deep dive on type systems and type checking.  Provides detailed explanations, formal proofs, and OCaml implementations of the type semantic for the untyped and simply-typed Lambda calculi, exceptions, mutability, subtyping, isorecursive and equirecursive types, polymorphism (including both Hindley-Milner/Algorithm W type inference and System F), and object-oriented nominal type systems.
